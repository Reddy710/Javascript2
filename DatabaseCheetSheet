Start with requirement analysis, in that we will see nouns, if noun is expandable to multiple information we will dedicate a table for it.
After that we have establish the relation between the tables using FK and relations 1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:N cordinalities. Based on this informmation we have to draw a schema design.
Once schema design is ready we have to perform CRUD(Create, Retrive, Update, Delete) operations in inserting data into tables
Agregate function
Date and time
Joins
alias
Trensactions(Read Uncommited, Read Commited, Repeatable Read, Serialization) and isolation techniques
subquires
Indexing(healper table) which uses Binary Search technique
Views.

Whole idea of Database Management System is to store the data in efficiently and retrive it efficiently.
