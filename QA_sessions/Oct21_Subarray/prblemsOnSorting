Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and is commonly used to solve various problems. Here are some problems based on sorting in JavaScript:

1. **Sort an Array of Numbers:**
   Write a function to sort an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.

2. **Sort an Array of Strings:**
   Sort an array of strings in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.

3. **Sort an Array of Objects:**
   Given an array of objects with a specific property, sort the objects based on that property. For example, sorting a list of people by their age or names.

4. **Sort an Array of Dates:**
   Sort an array of JavaScript `Date` objects in chronological order.

5. **Implement Merge Sort:**
   Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array.

6. **Find the Kth Largest Element:**
   Given an array, find the Kth largest element using a sorting algorithm or a specific technique like the QuickSelect algorithm.

7. **Group Anagrams:**
   Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. Two words are anagrams if they have the same characters but in a different order.

8. **Sort Colors:**
   Implement the Dutch National Flag problem, which involves sorting an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (representing red, white, and blue) in linear time.

9. **Find Intersection of Two Arrays:**
   Given two arrays, find their intersection (common elements) and return them in a sorted order.

10. **Custom Sorting Criteria:**
    Implement a custom sorting function that sorts elements based on a specific criterion. For example, sorting an array of objects based on multiple properties or complex rules.

11. **Top K Most Frequent Elements:**
    Given an array of integers, find the K most frequent elements and return them in descending order of frequency.

12. **Sort and Remove Duplicates:**
    Sort an array and then remove duplicate elements to get a sorted array with unique values.

13. **Find Median in a Stream:**
    Implement a data structure that can efficiently find the median of a stream of numbers. You'll need to use sorting or a more advanced algorithm like a heap.

14. **Sort Linked List:**
    Implement a sorting algorithm for a linked list, such as Merge Sort.

15. **Sort a Matrix:**
    Sort a 2D matrix by rows or columns.

These problems cover a range of difficulties and can be great practice for improving your understanding of sorting algorithms and their applications in JavaScript. Depending on the problem, you may choose to use built-in sorting functions like `Array.prototype.sort()` or implement sorting algorithms from scratch.
